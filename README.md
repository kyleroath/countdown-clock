### Why?

I was suggested to do this app by a close-friend, given my strong history on forgetfulness of birthdays, game releases and more. I wanted to put together what I had learned so far into a project of my own:

Ultimately, React is the next goal, but I did not want to move onto it until I had something to show for JavaScript. Enter the static site known as the ultimate countdown clock!

### How to Run
1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm run live` to fire up `live-server` using the given `/public` directory.
3. run `npm run build` to build a production copy into the `/public` folder

### Features
- add an event of your name choice and date to be saved in localstorage and used until deleted or browser clearing.
- chose from a list of events in the top left corner, selecting one will change to said event.
- get tidbits about the time until the event comes to pass.
- full breakdown of days, minutes, seconds, hours, etc until time comes to pass on the event. when times up event will say it has ended.
